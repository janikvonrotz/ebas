# Install

First of all you have to install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) which is part of [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/).

Afterwards you can install these packages with Npm on your command line:

[Bower](http://bower.io/) > `npm install bower -g` and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) > `npm install grunt-cli -g`.


<!-- To handle the required php packages you have to install [composer](https://getcomposer.org). -->

If you have installed all these tools you start to set up this project from your command line by running this commands:

`bower install`
`grunt`
<!-- `composer install` -->

The website is now ready to run.

As you should have seen this guide doesn't cover any webserver nor mysql installations. You have to do that on your own.

# Configure

Create a copy of the config file.

`config-example.json > config.json`
